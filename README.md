# Roblox-OSM
Renders the real world through Open Street Map.

# DISCLAIMERS
This is currently...
1. Inefficient
2. Useless
3. Kinda cool actualy
4. **A WORK IN PROGRESS**

# How it works
Honestly, at this point, it is to sloppy to say how it works. The next big revamp of the code will be to make it all easier to understand, and faster to load. Just wait a bit and i'll make sure to make it really easy to use in your own projects!

# Modules
Each module is something that this projects needs, but can be used for almost anything else as well!
## HexColorSupport
- Takes a hex color and makes it into a Color3!
## OverpassAPI
- Can be used to query OverpassAPI and returns the object.
## PartDisplaySystem
- Draws a line using parts. Cool, but limited.
